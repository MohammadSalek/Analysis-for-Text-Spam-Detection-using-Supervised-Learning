# Usage

Here's quick guide on how to setup your local machine for running the project source.

## Dependencies

- Install Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

- Install the dependencies in a conda environment: 

    `conda env create -f nlp_project_env.yml`

    (It may take a while to download and extract.)

- Activate the environment:
    
    `conda activate nlp_project`

    (you can deactivate later by using `conda deactivate`)

## Run

Simply go the project folder and run:

`jupyter notebook`

At this moment your machine must be set and ready to run the project!
